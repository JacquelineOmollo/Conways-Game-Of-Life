Understand
- Learn what the Game of Life game is and build it.
- rules:
    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


Plan
- set the init state
- create grid and it should be 25 X 25 of larger
- create buttons (start, stop, random, clear)
- should not be clickable while simulation is running
- should be able to toggle state (dead and alive)
- Text to display current generation # being displayed 


Execute
- Using react hooks for state management
- Code work out working solution

Refracture or Rework
- Always room for improvement
- Add more animation 
- Make sure MVP is three
- Go for the stretch goal
